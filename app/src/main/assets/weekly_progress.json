This usually happens within about 10 days of conception. However, because pregnancy        is dated from the first day of your last period, you are said to be four weeks pregnant. All women are different,        even if you have a cycle of five weeks, your baby will still be two weeks old when you missed your period.</p></h4>Folic acid</h4><p>Folic acid, which is also called folate, is a B vitamin. Folic acid is a pregnancy superhero! Taking a prenatal vitamin        with the recommended 400 micrograms (mcg) of folic acid before and during pregnancy can help prevent birth defects        of your baby's brain and spinal cord. The best food sources of folic acid are fortified cereals.</p><ul><li>Birth defects occur within the first 3-4 weeks of pregnancy. So it's important to have folic acid in your system            during those early stages when your baby's brain and spinal cord are developing</li><li>If you picked out your own prenatal vitamin, take it to your OB once you're pregnant to make sure it has the recommended            amounts of everything you need, including folic acid. All prenatal vitamins are not the same and some may have            less or more of the vitamins and minerals you need.</li></ul><h4>How much folic acid is recommended each day in terms of pregnancy:</h4><ul><li>While you're trying to conceive: 400 mcg</li><li>For the first three months of pregnancy: 400 mcg</li><li>For month’s four to nine of pregnancy: 600 mcg</li><li>While breastfeeding: 500 mcg</li></ul><h4>Without enough folic acid in your body, your baby's neural tube may not close correctly and she could develop health        problems called neural tube defects. These include:</h4><p><b>Spina bifida:</b>incomplete development of the spinal cord or the vertebrae</p><p><b>Anencephaly:</b>incomplete development of major parts of the brain</p><h4>If folic acid is taken before and during pregnancy, folic acid may also protect your baby against:</h4><ul><li>lip and palate</li><li>Premature birth</li><li>Low birth weight</li><li>Miscarriage</li><li>Poor growth in the womb</li></ul><h4>Folic acid has also been suggested to reduce your risk of:</h4><p>Pregnancy complications (One report found that women who took folic acid supplements during the second trimester had a reduced risk of preeclampsia.)</p><ul><li>Heart disease</li><li>Stroke</li><li>Some types of cancers</li><li>Alzheimer’s disease.</li></ul><h4>Advice</h4><p>If you find it difficult to taking your prenatal, talk to your doctor to see if he can give you a prenatal supplement        with less iron or give you folic acid supplement also.

        "title": "<h4>Early pregnancy discomforts</h4>",
        "intro": "<p>Pregnancy is different for every woman. Some women glow with good health and vitality during those first three months; others feel absolutely miserable. Here are some of the changes you might experience, what they mean, and which signs warrant a call to your doctor.</p>",
        "body": "<b>Nausea and vomiting</b><ul><li>About half of all pregnant women experience nausea and sometimes vomiting in the first trimester--also called morning sickness because symptoms are most severe in the morning. Some women may have nausea and vomiting throughout the pregnancy. Morning sickness may be due to the changes in hormone levels during pregnancy.</li><li> Morning sickness seems to be aggravated by stress, traveling, and certain foods, such as spicy or fatty foods. Eating small meals several times a day may help lessen the symptoms. A diet high in protein and complex carbohydrates (such as whole wheat bread, pasta, bananas, and green, leafy vegetables) may also help reduce the severity of the nausea.</li><li>If vomiting is severe, causing a woman to lose fluids and weight, it may indicate a condition called hyperemesis gravidarum. Hyperemesis can lead to dehydration and may require hospitalization for intravenous fluids and nutrition. Call your physician or midwife if you are having constant or severe nausea and vomiting.</li></ul><b>Fatigue</b><p>As the body works overtime to provide a nourishing environment for the fetus, it is no wonder a pregnant woman often feels tired. In the first trimester, her blood volume and other fluids increase as her body adjusts to the pregnancy. Sometimes anemia is the underlying cause of the fatigue. Anemia is a reduction in the oxygen-carrying capability of red blood cells, and is usually due to low iron levels. A simple blood test performed at a prenatal visit will check for anemia.</p><b>Breast tenderness</b><p>Breast tenderness. Sore breasts are one of the earliest signs of pregnancy. They're triggered by hormonal changes, which are preparing your milk ducts to feed your baby, and will probably last through the first trimester. Going up a bra size (or more).  Wearing a support bra can make you feel more comfortable; you can go back to the lacy bras after your baby is finished nursing.</p><b>Bleeding</b><p>About 25% of pregnant women experience slight bleeding during their first trimester. Early in the pregnancy, light spotting may be a sign that the fertilized embryo has implanted in the uterus. However, if you have significant bleeding, cramping, or sharp pain in your abdomen, call your doctor. These could be signs of a miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy (a pregnancy in which the embryo implants outside of the uterus).</p><b>Constipation</b><p>During pregnancy, the muscle contractions that normally move food through your intestines slow down because of higher levels of the hormone progesterone. Add to that the extra iron you're getting from your prenatal vitamin, and the result is uncomfortable constipation and gas that can keep you feeling bloated throughout your pregnancy.</p><b>Advice</b><ul><li>Increase your fiber intake and drink extra fluids to keep things moving more smoothly. Physical activity can also help.</li><li>If your constipation is really bothering you, talk to your doctor about what mild laxative or stool softeners are safe to use during pregnancy.</li></ul><b>Discharge</b><p>It's normal to see a thin, milky white discharge (called leukorrhea) early in your pregnancy. You can wear a panty liner if it makes you feel more comfortable, but don't use a tampon because it can introduce germs into the vagina. If the discharge is foul-smelling, green, or yellow, or if there's a lot of clear discharge, call your doctor.</p><b>Food craving or aversion</b><p>Your tastes can change while you're pregnant. More than 60% of pregnant women experience food cravings, and more than half have food aversions, according to research. Giving in to cravings from time to time is OK, provided you are generally eating healthy, low-calorie foods.<ul><li>The exception is pica -- a craving for non-foods like clay, dirt, and laundry starch, which can be dangerous for you and your baby. If you experience this kind of craving, report it to your doctor right away. </li></ul></p><b>Frequent Urination</b><p>Your baby is still pretty small, but your uterus is growing and it's putting pressure on your bladder. As a result, you may feel like you constantly have to go to the bathroom. Don't stop drinking fluids -- your body needs them -- but do cut down on caffeine (which stimulates the bladder), especially before bedtime. When nature calls, answer it as soon as you can. Don't hold it in.</p><b>Heartburn</b><ul><li>During pregnancy, your body produces more of the progesterone hormone which relaxes smooth muscles -- including the ring of muscle in your lower esophagus that normally keeps food and acids down in your stomach. This muscle relaxation can lead to acid reflux, otherwise known as heartburn.</li><li>To avoid the burn, eat frequent, smaller meals throughout the day; don't lie down right after eating; and avoid greasy, spicy, and acidic foods (like citrus fruits). You can also try raising your pillows when you sleep.</li></ul><b>Weight gain</b><p>Pregnancy weight gain is considered a good thing, but don't overdo it. During the first trimester, you should gain about 3 to 6 pounds (your doctor may recommend that you adjust your weight gain up or down if you started your pregnancy underweight or overweight). Although you're carrying an extra person, don't go by the adage of \"eating for two.\" You only need about an extra 150 calories a day during your first trimester. Get those calories the healthy way, by adding extra fruits and vegetables, milk, whole-grain bread, and lean meat to your diet.</p><b>RED FLAG</b><p>Any of these symptoms could be a sign that something is seriously wrong with your pregnancy. Don't wait for your prenatal visit to talk about it. Call your doctor right away if you experience:</p><ul><li>Severe abdominal pain.</li><li>Significant bleeding.</li><li>Severe dizziness.</li><li>Rapid weight gain or too little weight gain.</li></ul>"

Part of it was due to women tending to wait until they were older to have a baby. As you get older, hormonal changes make it more likely that your body will release more than one egg at a time.

        "body": "<p>But most of the rise in multiple births was due to the use of fertility drugs and assisted reproductive technology (ART) to help women conceive.
